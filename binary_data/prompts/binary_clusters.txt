-Goal-  
Given a question and a list of answers, strictly classify the answers into exactly two clusters based on their semantic meaning using the question as a context.  

-Steps-  
1. Analyze the given question as context and strictly classify each answer from the provided list as either positive or negative.

2. Assign each answer to one of the following clusters, ensuring the classification aligns with the context of the question:
    - Cluster 1: Contains all positive or mildly positive answers.
    - Cluster 0: Contains all negative or mildly negative answers.

3. Ensure that:  
   - Each text entry is strictly assigned to exactly one of the two clusters.  
   - Classification is consistent and aligned with the semantic meaning.

-Output Format-  
Return a dictionary formatted as follows:  
{
  0: [negative_text1, negative_text2, ...],
  1: [positive_text1, positive_text2, ...]
}

-Constraints-
- Strictly return only the dictionary with no additional text, commentary, or explanations.
- Maintain consistency in classification based on semantic meaning.
